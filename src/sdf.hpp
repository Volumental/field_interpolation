/*
This library helps you set up a sparse linear system to estimate a field from a set of constraints.
The field will be represented by a square lattice (a grid).
There are two types of constraint:
	* Model constraint. These are equations describing the smoothness of the field.
	* Data constraints. This is specific things we know about the field. Can be:
		* The value of the field at a given position
		* The gradient of the field at a given position.

By using a sparse least squares linear solver you will get a field which
minimizes the errors of these constraints.

Each constraint can have a weight. In particular,
your data points can have high weights if they are trustworthy or low otherwise.
Your model constraint weights may be high if you trust that the field is smooth.
You can thus tweak the relative weights for:
	* A lot of noisy data (high smoothness weight, low data weight)
	* Sparse and accurate data (low smoothness weight, hight data weight)
	* Sharpness/smoothness of model (soft hills or sharp mountains?)

The library is agnostic to dimensionality, but was mainly designed for low-dimensional systems.
In particular: 1D, 2D, 3D.

Example use cases:
	* Fit a smooth curve to some data
	* Generate a signed distance field (sdf) from a set of surface points

The lattice coordinates go from [0, 0, ...] to [width - 1, height - 1, ...] (inclusive).

/// A note about picking good parameters:
/// If your model is continuous but with abrupt changes, use a high model_1 and low everything else.
/// If your model is smooth, use a high model_2 and low everything else.
