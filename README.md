# Signed distance field from least-squares of sparse linear equations

# TODO
* Visualize certainty (abs-gradient should be one if trustable)
* 1D ImGui with very simple model and graph and low-res
	* Use to verify iso-surface positioning is perfect
* Measure point cloud area more accurately
* Add option to make point distribution lob-sided (more on right than on the left).
* Persist parameters after startup
