# Signed distance field from least-squares of sparse linear equations

# TODO
* Visualize certainty (abs-gradient should be one if trustable)
* 1D ImGui with very simple model and graph and low-res
	* Use to verify iso-surface positioning is perfect
* Non-square polygons
* Persist parameters after startup
* Try dual contouring
