# Signed distance field from least-squares of sparse linear equations

# TODO
* Other shapes:
	* Box
	* Something intricate, e.g. a fork.
* Visualize certainty (abs-gradient should be one if trustable)
* 1D ImGui with very simple model and graph and low-res
	* Use to verify iso-surface positioning is perfect
* Generalize code to multiple dimensions
